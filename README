I'm not sure why you'd use this, but if you do the variables are set at the top of 'index.js'.

Realize this was (poorly) written by a novice in HTML/JS/CSS.

In part so that I could get what I want, and in part to (attempt) to learn.

If you use this to create an extension Mozilla will throw errors about innerHTML.

Haven't gotten far enough along to fix that yet.

Don't think it's an actual issue as it's not taking user input.  Still something I'd like to fix.
